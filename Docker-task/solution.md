### Introduction

Docker is a popular tool used in DevOps to make it easier to build, test, and run applications. It helps package an app along with everything it needs—like libraries and settings—into something called a **container**. This makes sure the app runs the same way no matter where you launch it, whether it's on a developer's laptop or a production server.

### What is Docker:- 
Docker is an open-source platform that makes it easier to create, run, and manage applications using containers.

### Virtualization vs. Containerization

**Virtualization** uses virtual machines (VMs) to run multiple systems on one computer. Each VM has its own full operating system, which makes it heavy and slow to start.

**Containerization**, used by tools like Docker, runs applications in containers that share the same operating system. Containers are much lighter and start much faster than VMs.

| Feature            | Virtualization                        | Containerization                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Size               | Large (includes full OS)              | Small (shares OS)                      |
| Speed              | Slower to start                       | Starts quickly                         |
| Resource Use       | Uses more memory and CPU              | Uses less memory and CPU               |
| Portability        | Harder to move                        | Easy to move and run anywhere          |

### Why Containers Are Better for Microservices and CI/CD

Containers work really well for **microservices** because each service can run in its own container. This makes it easier to update, test, and scale each part of an app separately. In **CI/CD pipelines**, containers make the process faster and more reliable by ensuring the app runs the same way at every step—from coding and testing to deployment. That’s why containerization is the preferred choice in modern DevOps.
